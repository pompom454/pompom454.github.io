### pompom454's Personal Page
_**HEEWWWWWOOOOOOO**_! I am just a guy who likes random things for like, no apparent reason at all. There are many projects I am invested and dedicated to. It takes time to finish these projects and, frankly, I get exhausted once I figure something hard out. But nothing is too hard, too big, and also too small! I use a Raspberry Pi 4B, a Wii, an Xbox 360, and a PS Vita. And only ONE of them is softmodded. Take a guess.

I mostly wanna help out in video game modding and also preservation of video games, as video games mean _**WONDERS**_ to me. My childhood hero has to be Pac-Man. I remember that Flash interpretation of the game on those websites..._sigh_ oh the glory days. I have lots of interests, and I might as well explain. I love Sonic, Pac-Man, Mario, Rayman, Sly Cooper, Kirby, Disney Infinity...

...Project+, and lastly, The Bad Guys.

### Did you follow that?

Well, _**GOOD**_!

My favorite pangram has to be:
#### "The July sun caused a fragment of black pine wax to ooze on the velvet quilt, jeopardizing every view."
It just sounds so smooth... okay, maybe it sounds like a lollipop crunching in your mouth, but still! For me, it feels quite like soap. Smooth, runs over fast... what other adjectives can I add here??? Oh, well. I feel this'll be it. You can [check out any of my projects](https://github.com/pompom454) or just... I don't know, read this again? Weird, but maybe there's something _**GASP**_ HIDDEN LIKE _**LORE**_?!?!?!!!?!????! Nah, just kidding.
